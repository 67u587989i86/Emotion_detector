# Emotion Detection System (Text-Based)

A simple **Python NLP project** that detects a person’s emotion from written text and provides a **supportive tip** based on the detected emotion.

The system interacts with the user in a friendly manner by asking their name, analyzing what they write, and responding with a **human-readable emotion** (not numeric labels).

## What This Project Does

* Greets the user by name
